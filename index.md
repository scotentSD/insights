title: Welcome to the Scottish Enterprise content guidelines
---

We’ve created a set of guidelines to help you create content for Scottish Enterprise digital platforms. They'll help make sure the user experience is consistent across the website, and that our content is easy for users to read and understand.

They contains general guidelines for writing, structuring and testing content, as well as some style guides to make sure we’re consistent across the site.

Our guidelines are unique to Scottish Enterprise platforms, but they complement guidelines and style guides used across other government services.


### Using the guidelines

Remember that these are just guidelines, not fixed rules. The most important thing is that our content is clear, easy to understand and supports a good user experience. If that means straying away from the guidelines every now and then, that’s fine.


### Acknowledgement

We'd like to credit MailChimp for the inspiration for these content guidelines.

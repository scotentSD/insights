Search engine optimisation (SEO) helps search engines like Google know when to show one of our pages for a user's search query. To help our content be seen by as many potential customers as possible, we can use SEO best practises:

*	Produce high-quality, unique content
*	Target relevant keywords (our analytics team can help you define the keywords you should be targeting to reach a wider audience)
*	Create concise and appealing meta data 
*	Create internal links between pages 

If you're already following our other guidelines, your content should already be on its way to good SEO. If you're writing in plain English and putting the customer first, then you're probably already writing content that users are interested in, using the language they use. This is an important part of SEO. 

If you think you need some extra help with SEO, just get in touch with our analytics team who can help you optimise your content.

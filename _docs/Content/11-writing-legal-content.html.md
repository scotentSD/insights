Itâ€™s important that our legal content is just as easy to understand as all the other content on our site.

Follow the same practises when writing legal content as you would when writing any other content. This means writing in plain English, explaining complicated terms if we need to use them, considering accessibility and structuring the content well.

You'll need to work closely with legal teams to make sure that your simplified version of legal text is still legally correct. As always, if there are some terms you can't avoid using, just make sure to clearly explain them. 

Legal content should also be tested with users to see if they understand it.

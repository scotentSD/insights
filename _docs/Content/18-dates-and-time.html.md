**Dates**

Use upper case for months: January, February

Do not use a comma between the month and year: 4 June 2017

Ehen space is an issue - in tables or publication titles, for example - you can use truncated months: Jan, Feb

We use ‘to’ in date ranges - not hyphens, en rules or em dashes. For example:	
* tax year 2011 to 2012
* Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (put different days on a new line, do not separate with a comma)
* 10 November to 21 December

When referring to today (as in a news article) include the date: ‘The minister announced today (14 June 2012) that…’

**Times**

Use ‘to’ in time ranges, not hyphens, en rules or em dashes: 10am to 11am (not 10-11am)

Format times in the following ways:
* 5:30pm (not 1730hrs)
*	midnight (not 00:00)
*	midday (not 12 noon, noon or 12pm)
*	6 hours 30 minutes

Midnight is the first minute of the day, not the last. You should consider using “11:59pm” to avoid confusion about a single, specific time. For example, “You must register by 11:59pm on Tuesday 14 June” can only be read one way, but “You must register by midnight on Tuesday 14 June” can be read in two ways (the end of Monday 13, or end of Tuesday 14).

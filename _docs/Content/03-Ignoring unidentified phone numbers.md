## Summary
- People are increasingly ignoring calls from 0800 numbers
- They are also ignoring numbers without Call Line Identification (CLI)
- People are communicating through so many channels
  - They have to ration the time given to communication channels
  - They are far more likely to know who is contacting them (online channels) and this attitude is lowering patience for unknown or commonly frivolous numbers.

## Summary
During Covid, businesses may experience issues with handling "Physical Post"
- Letters and Parcels are still addressed to offices
- Offices have periods of being unmanned
- You can't hand out employees home addresses
- Having physical Post collected shares the same issues

SO
- Some staff could visit offices in "managed ways" periodically
- Some mail redirect methods were used
- Messaging to customers and clients was needed to highlight the extra time needed to process and respond to physical artefacts
- Talking to banks to "increase flexibility to reflect these longer response times and Cash Flow issues" was needed.


## Chronology

- Business offices were open and closed throughout 2020


## Variations

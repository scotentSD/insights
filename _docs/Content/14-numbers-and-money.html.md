**Basic numbers** 

In most cases, write all numbers as numerals except for 'one'. There were 3 people on the team. We met 56 new members. 
Spell out first to ninth, then use numerals - 10th, 15th, 60th. 

There are a few exceptions:
* Use '1' if you're talking about a step
* Use '1' if using our stats component - for example to say 'Number 1 in the world' 
* Common expressions like 'there were one of two problems'
* If a number starts a sentence, write it out in full. 'Thirty-four people came to the event'. This doesn't apply to headings or subheadings
* If using the stats component, use 1st to 9th. '5th largest in the world'

Use 'to' instead of a dash. '300 to 400 people attended the event'.

**Large numbers**

Numbers over 999 should use a comma for clarity: 6,000. 

Millions should be spelt out. 5 million, not 5,000,000. Do not abbreviate to 5m.

Do not use 0.xx million for numbers less than a million. Do not use 0.xx billion for numbers less than 1 billion
Say '600,000' not 0.6 million.

**Ages**

Do not use hyphens in ages unless to avoid confusion, although it’s always best to write in a way that avoids ambiguity. For example, ‘a class of 15 16-year-old students took the A level course’ can be written as ‘15 students aged 16 took the A level course’.


**Fractions, percentages and other maths**

Spell out common fractions like one-half and one-third.

Use a % sign for percentages: 50%

In tables, use numerals throughout.

Ratios have no space either side of the colon: 5:12


**Money** 

Use the £ symbol: £75. 

Use the euro symbol if writing in euros: €56 million. 

Other common currencies should use their abbreviations: 500USD, 500AUD. 

Less common currencies should be spelled out: 500 South African rand. 

Write out pence in full: calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline.

Do not use decimals unless pence are included: £75.50 but not £75.00

Currencies are lower case.

This list helps clarify the spelling and formatting of words and terms that may be used on the GlobalScot platform. It’s an edited version of the Government Digital Service A-Z style guide, refined to include only the relevant words.


**adviser**

For example, special adviser. Not advisor, but advisory is the correct adjective.

**board**

Always lower case unless it’s part of a proper title: so upper case for the Judicial Executive Board, but lower case for a business's advisory board. 

**Brand names**

Always spell and format brand names the way the brand spells and formats them.

Avoid using branded or trademarked names if you don't need to - for example, use 'You can complete this form on a tablet' rather than 'You can complete this form on an iPad.'

**Brexit**

Not ‘EU Exit’.

“No-deal Brexit” rather than “No deal Brexit”.

**Britain, British**

Use UK and United Kingdom in preference to Britain and British (UK business, UK foreign policy, ambassador and high commissioner). But British embassy, not UK embassy.

**Business member**

Within the network, business members are users who have joined to access support from our GlobalScots. They should not be referred to as ‘Non-GlobalScots’. They should also not be referred to as 'businesses' - business members register as individuals and may have more than one business associated with their profile. 

**chair of governors**

Lower case.

**chairman, chairwoman, chairperson**

Lower case in text. Upper case in titles: Spencer Tracy, Chairman, GDS.

**checkbox**

Not “check box”.

**click**

Don’t use “click” when talking about user interfaces because not all users click. Use “select”.

**community feed**

Lower case. Refers to the community feed feature on the platform. Once introduced as the 'community feed', you can refer to it as simply the feed. 'Welcome to our community feed. On the feed you'll find....' 

**Corporation Tax**

Upper case.

**countries and territories**

When referring to a country or territory, use the names listed in the country register or territory register.

**Customs Duty**

Upper case.

**customs union**

Lower case. Only use upper case when part of the title of a specific customs union: the European Union Customs Union, for example.

Treat as a singular noun: The data is stored on a secure server.

**data set**

Not “dataset”.

**defence**

Lower case even when referring to the defence team at the MOD.

**email**

One word.

**Email addresses**

Write email addresses in full, in lower case and as active links. Do not include any other words in the link text.

**European Economic Area (EEA)**

Avoid using as it is not widely understood. Say ‘the EU, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein’.

When rules covering the EEA also cover Switzerland, say ‘the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein’.

**European Union vs European Community**

Use EU when you mean EU member states: EU countries, EU businesses, EU consumers, goods exported from the EU, EU VAT numbers.

EC should be used when it’s EC directives, EC Sales List.

**euros, the euro**

Lower case.

**executive director**

Lower case in text. Upper case in titles: Spencer Tracy, Executive Director, GDS.

Lower case.

**GlobalScot, GlobalScots**

Capital ‘G’, capital ‘S’, all one word. Refers only to the people in the network who offer business support to the businesses in the network.

**government**

Lower case unless it’s a full title. For example: ‘UK government’, but ‘Her Majesty’s Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland’.

Also ‘Welsh Government’, as it’s the full title.

**Group**

Upper case for names of groups, directorates and organisations: Knowledge and Innovation Group.

Lower case when a group has a very generic title like working group or research team.

**Help request**

Avoid using this phrase. Instead, use a verb form. For example, say 'Request help from this GlobalScot' instead of 'Submit a help request to this GlobalScot'. 

**ID**

In technical writing, don’t write ‘identification’ or ‘identifier’, unless it’s part of a standard abbreviation. For example, ‘unique identifier (UID)’.

**Import Control System**

Upper case.

**IP**

When used in the technical context (for example ‘internet protocol’), there’s no need to explain the acronym.

If using to mean intellectual property, always spell it out in full first. If you think there's likely to be any confusion - for example if you're talking about an IP address and intellectual property in the same article, make sure to spell it out in full.

**life cycle**

Not “lifecycle” or “life-cycle”. For example, ‘product life cycle’.

**member states of the EU**

Lower case.

**Middle East**

Upper case.

**minister**

Use upper case for the full title, like Minister for Overseas Development, or when used with a name, as a title, like Health Minister Norman Lamb.

When used without the name, shortened titles are lower case: The health minister welcomed the research team.

**multilingual**

One word.

**N/A**

Separate with a slash. Only use in tables.

**the network**

When referring to the GlobalScot network, the network refers to the people within the network. The network includes GlobalScots, business members, staff and partners. ‘The platform’ refers to the website itself.

For example: ‘HMPO is the sole issuer of UK passports. They will send your new passport within 3 weeks’.

The definite article can be used when referring to the organisation by its full name, but should not be used with the organisation’s acronym: ‘You should contact the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency if…’ but ‘You should contact DVSA if…’

**PDF**

Upper case. No need to explain the acronym.

**Per cent**

Use per cent not percent. Percentage is one word. Always use % with a number.

**SMEs**

This acronym means small and medium-sized enterprises. Use SME for the singular.

**Spotlight**

Upper case. This is the only feature that should start with a capital letter, and this is to clarify it's a specific feature, rather than using the term more generally.

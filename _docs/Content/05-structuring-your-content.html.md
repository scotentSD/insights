When writing content, consider how information is structured on the page, as well as where the page sits within a wider journey or section. Clearly structured content is a key principle of plain English, and also supports better accessibility.

**Break up long content into headings and short paragraphs**

This makes it easier to scan and feels less overwhelming.

**Use clear headings**

Headings should clearly sum up what the paragraph will be about.

**Think about hierarchy of information**

Make sure your key points and information are at the top, with more detailed information further down.

**Consider context**

Always think about where the content will sit in relation to the rest of the journey and the rest of the site. Don’t duplicate information that the user has already seen or will see next. Consider what they already know and what they need to know at this stage.

**Use bullet points to break up lists or long paragraphs**

Bullet points are easy to scan and get information across quickly.

## Summary
Over the course of 2020, most companies gradually lost urgency over Brexit.
Repeated Deadlines and False starts eroded the sense of urgency in them.
There were also quite a lot of people who were stung following previous advice, and were very cautious about actually actioning any plans.

## Chronology
- Mid 2019
  - Lots of anxiety
  - High appetite for information
  - Frustration around lack of information

- Late 2020
  - Noticeable reticence about trusting government sources
  - Examples of companies that had either been stung, or realised that they would have suffered,  from following previous government advice.

- Early 2020
  - Highly depleted appetite for Brexit advice
  - Quite high doubt about Brexit readiness advice from Government sources

## Variations
- There is a high degree of variability between sectors
- Sectors such a Food & Drink have highly integrated Vertical Supply chains, often within Europe. Ability to Import Ingredients and then Export finished products back to Europe is critical.

## Summary

- Customers repeatedly say that the length of time we take to make decisions can be damaging to them
- They also say "Tell me NO quicker". This means they don't waste time waiting for us, and can pursue other opportunities


## Chronology
- As more of each process is digitised, it should speed up decisions but this still remains to be seen. 

## Variations

In 2020 it takes: 
- 22 days for Small Grants
- 32 days for RSA
- 53 days for SMART grants
from application to issue of offer

There are also similar insights around how we communicate updates during the waiting period.

To help you write for the platform, we’ve created some style guides that are bespoke to the GlobalScot platform. They’ll make sure we’re consistently spelling words, using capital letters and formatting content.  

**Our word list**

This contains information about formatting of words you might need to use on the platform, including when to capitalise. This includes words specific to the platform, like the names of features or how we refer to our members.

**Formatting and grammar**

We have a number of formatting guides under the 'Style guides' navigation section. These include how to use capital letters correctly, how to format numbers, how to format bullet points and more.

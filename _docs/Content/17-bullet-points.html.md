You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:
*	you always use a lead-in line
*	the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
*	you use lower case at the start of the bullet
*	you do not use more than one sentence per bullet point - use commas or dashes to expand on an item
*	you do not put ‘or’ or ‘and’ after the bullets
*	you do not make the whole bullet a link if it’s a long phrase
*	you do not put a semicolon at the end of a bullet
*	there is no full stop after the last bullet point

Bullets should normally form a complete sentence following from the lead text. 

Always make it clear whether the bullet list is exhaustive and how many points apply to the user. For example 'To join, you'll need to meet all of the following criteria', 'To join, you'll need to meet at least one of the following criteria'.

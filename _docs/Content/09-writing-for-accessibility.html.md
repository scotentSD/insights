We want our services to be enjoyed by everyone. This means creating a platform that’s accessible and easy to use, whether a user is colour-blind, dyslexic, using a screen reader or has any other accessibility requirement.

Using plain English and testing content with a wide variety of users will help improve the accessibility of the platform. However, there’s other things you should consider too.

## Key accessibility principles ##
* Make sure heading tags (like H1, H2 and H3) are used appropriately to structure content. Try not to skip from a H2 to a H4
* Avoid directional language that relies on the user being able to see the page – such as saying ‘Use the filters on the right-hand side to narrow your results’
* Avoid writing in all caps
* If an image provides key information - such as an infographic - make sure to give it useful alt text. If it's there just for visual appeal, it doesn't need alt text.

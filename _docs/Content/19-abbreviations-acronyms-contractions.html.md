**Abbreviations**

We might use abbreviations internally, but we can’t be sure users will know what these mean. Always question whether you need to use an abbreviation. If you don’t, just spell it out in full each time. If you do, spell it out in full the first time, with the abbreviation in brackets next to it. You can then use the abbreviation for subsequent mentions.

This doesn’t apply to abbreviations that are well known and you can be sure the user will recognise. This could include UK, US, EU, VAT and MP. 

Do not use full stops in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.

**eg, etc and ie**

eg can sometimes be read aloud as ‘egg’ by screen reading software. Instead use ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’ - whichever works best in the specific context.

etc can usually be avoided. Try using ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’. Never use etc at the end of a list starting with these words.

ie - used to clarify a sentence - is not always well understood. Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it. If that is not possible, use an alternative such as ‘meaning’ or ‘that is’.

**Contractions**

We tend to use contractions to make our writing feel less formal and more friendly. So feel free to say it’s, you’re, we’ll etc. 

However, avoid negative contractions like can’t and don’t. Many users find them harder to read, or misread them as the opposite of what they say. Use cannot, instead of can’t.

Avoid should’ve, could’ve, would’ve, they’ve too. These can also be hard to read.

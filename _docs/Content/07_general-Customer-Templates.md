## Summary
- Customers often ask for templates as they are unsure what layout/format is required
- They also want guidance on how to present the information (if not using a template)
- We sometimes set up expectations of templates but then do not expose the templates obviously enough

## Chronology
- This is a long-running issue observed over dozens of test rounds

## Variations
- Us imposing a template
- Customers requesting a template
- Customers requesting advice on how to format a response
- Customers having an application rejected because of the wrong format

## Supporting reports and other sources
- Almost all test rounds that contain application processes or other forms
